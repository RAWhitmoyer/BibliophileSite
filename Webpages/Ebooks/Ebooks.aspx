        One-fifth of American adults (21%) report that they have read an e-book in the past year, 
        and this number increased following a gift-giving season that saw a spike in the ownership 
        of both tablet computers and e-book reading devices such as the original Kindles and Nooks. 
        In mid-December 2011, 17% of American adults had reported they read an e-book in the previous year; 
        by February, 2012, the share increased to 21%.
        <br /><br />
        The rise of e-books in American culture is part of a larger story about a shift from printed to digital material. 
        Using a broader definition of e-content in a survey ending in December 2011, some 43% of Americans age 16 
        and older say they have either read an e-book in the past year or have read other long-form content such as 
        magazines, journals, and news articles in digital format on an e-book reader, tablet computer, regular computer, or cell phone.

        Those who have taken the plunge into reading e-books stand out in almost every way from other kinds of readers. 
        Foremost, they are relatively avid readers of books in all formats: 88% of those who read e-books in the past 
        12 months also read printed books. Compared with other book readers, they read more books. They read more 
        frequently for a host of reasons: for pleasure, for research, for current events, and for work or school. 
        They are also more likely than others to have bought their most recent book, rather than borrowed it, and 
        they are more likely than others to say they prefer to purchase books in general, often starting their search online.
