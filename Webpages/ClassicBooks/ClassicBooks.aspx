    <h2>The classic books page</h2>

        When you read the classics, you’re reading books that have had a pivotal role in shaping 
        the way we read and write today. Books aren’t written or read in a vacuum. They’re 
        woven by writers and consumed by readers with the influence of centuries of writing 
        behind us. Whether we’re conscious of it or not, reading a book is never an isolated 
        incident but part of a tradition.
        <br /><br />
        The classics are the milestones of our literary tradition. Some classics rise to prominence 
        as the shining example of a movement (like realism or romanticism) or a genre (like science 
        fiction or historical fiction). They sparked a literary trend because they did it first or 
        they did it best. Other classics become so because they push the envelope. By breaking from 
        tradition and questioning established ideas, these books became markers of creative rebellion 
        and dissent.

        When you familiarize yourself with the classics, you start to understand where a lot of 
        other books fit in. You’ll begin to identify influences and references in your reading 
        that you weren’t able to before, or didn’t even notice. It’s like developing a sudden 
        appreciation of wine—different notes open up to your palate, you detect hidden floral, 
        fruity, or oaky elements, and you’re better able to articulate your tastes.
