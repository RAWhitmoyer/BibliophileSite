    <h2>The bibliophile page</h2>
    <p style="margin: 12px; line-height: 1.2; font-size: 16px">The word “bibliophile” literally means a lover (phile) of books (biblio). 
        The term is often thrown around to refer to people who simply like to read, 
        but in its most precise interpretation, “bibliophile” means something more specific: 
        someone who loves books particularly—how they look, how they smell, what they feel like. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Of course, most bibliophiles are great readers, collecting (OK, hoarding) books in part because they love the narratives in them. 
        But they also value books as fascinating objects in themselves, objects with their own stories to tell. 
        These are readers who will never really be satisfied with electronic books—how can a 
        cold iPad screen possibly compare to a tattered, musty, well-loved print book?

        There are many things that bibliophiles have in common. For example, many of them have a personal copy 
        and a loaner copy of their favorite books. That way, they don't have to worry about being without it. Additionally, 
        many bibliophiles even use their books as decor throughout their house. They even often find themselves pondering different 
        ways in which they can organize their collections. Finally, some go as far as judging others based on the books they read and the 
        the books they have, but I mean, who wouldn't?
